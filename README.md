# Fruitmark
A fruit distribution company (Fruitmark) has several stores in 5 cities in France (Marsela, Paris, Dijon, Niza, Lila). Each store sells 5 types of fruit (orange, banana, apple, strawberry, cherry).

The director of the Fruitmark stores wants to manage his fruit stocks via a mobile application. He would like to know his stocks by connecting to his mobile application.

1. I log in and see the status of my fruit stocks by city thanks to a carefully displayed table. The table displays for each city, the total stock of fruits and the stock of each fruit.
2. A small dynamic form allowing to transfer fruits from a site A to a site B. Example: I want to send 10 bananas from the store in Marseille to the one in Lille, thus updating the database and its live display. This is a simple and straightforward problem.
3. The customer via a public access can see the stock in real time on the application (no need to log in).
4. The application is obviously simple and ergonomic (For the evaluation of the applications, we will also look at the care that has been put into this part)
